"""Group 3: Lagrangian scalarisation over a budget controller.

Every legal action for the day - a wear pair plus a discard subset of the
leftovers - is scored with one function and the argmin is returned:

    cost = embarrassment(i, j)
         + lam * dollars(i, j, S)
         + mu  * migration(i, j, S)
         + nu  * delta_potential(i, j, S)

``dollars`` is the household's expected replacement bill: $10/6 per voluntary
discard, plus a quarter of that for every worn-out sock we put on, because the
engine rolls a 25% hole on capped socks and a hole is a discard we did not
choose. ``migration`` charges the same expected number of new socks in a
second currency: every pristine replacement must absorb 64 wears before it
rejoins a saturated drawer, and the household only has 2n wears per day, so
each new sock consumes 64/(2n) days of the household's wear capacity.

``delta_potential`` estimates future mismatch while the candidate and the
observed same-colour drawer age together, one expected wash per wear step.
The geometric replacement target remains stationary, representing continued
replenishment. The projection uses the target mixture and survival discount,
ending at the expected wears remaining in the game. Historical observations
use recency decay.

``lam`` is not fixed. The controller from the previous player survives: it
infers the roommates' spend rate from ``total_spent``, banks the shortfall
against the budget as discard credit, scales lam down to zero as the bank
fills (a slack constraint has a zero multiplier), and sets lam to a survival
value once the money is gone so that the cost of a hole dominates any
mismatch. With lam at infinity and no credit the policy degenerates to
never-discard wear-levelling; with lam near zero it is the churn regime. One
code path covers the whole range.

The roommates
-------------
Nothing in the cost function names them, which is the point: the engine
scores our pair against our pair, so the other n-1 roommates reach us only
through the two things the household shares. The drawer is one pool: they draw
from it uniformly at random, in a freshly shuffled order every day, and
whatever survives the day goes back in for anyone to draw tomorrow - socks
anyone wore, a wash older, and socks anyone declined, unaged. The budget is
one account: it is charged in $10 six-packs as soon as six discards of a
colour have piled up, from any mix of their discards, our discards and holes.
We never see a roommate's hand or their move, and the engine tells nobody who
discarded what, so our whole model of them is built from two signals.

The first is the handful we are dealt. It is a uniform sample of the pool as
the household left it, so the decayed histogram in ``_observe`` is a rolling
estimate of a drawer that everyone is reshaping, and every belief built on it
is household-wide rather than ours. That is why ``_potential`` scores a sock
against a partner drawn at random from the pool rather than against anything
we are holding, and why ``_life_potential`` ages it at the household's wear
rate: a sock we hand back is worn next by whoever draws it, and we see it
again only with probability unit/C. It is also why saving a good sock for
tomorrow is not an available move. Discarding is our only lever on what the
pool contains, and it is the lever that spends everybody's money.

The second signal is ``turn.total_spent``, and ``_may_discard`` is built
around it: subtract the spend we impute to ourselves, divide by the day, and
the remainder is the roommates' rate. Extrapolated to the end of the run and
netted against a reserve, it leaves the slack that decides whether we may
discard at all - so the two regimes fall out of one expression, with no
branch dedicated to either. Against roommates who churn freely their
extrapolated spend swallows the budget, the slack goes negative, the credit
bank empties, and lam sits at full price with zero discards allowed: we stop
paying and dress out of the fresh drawer they are buying. lam still earns its
keep there, because the 25% hole on a worn-out sock is the one way left to
spend the household's money without choosing to, and that term is what steers
us off capped socks. Against hoarders the slack is the whole budget less the
hole replacements their wears force, the bank fills, lam decays toward zero,
and we pay to churn the drawer ourselves. The free-rider asymmetry behind all
of this - a sock we replace improves every roommate's draws as much as our
own, and theirs improve ours - is not fought, only priced: a channel that
carries one number a day leaves nothing to signal, bargain or retaliate with,
so their rate is taken as exogenous.

That inference has two known weaknesses. Holes are charged to the household
but imputed to nobody, so they land in the roommates' rate - including the
ones our own worn-out wears cause - which grows with the length of the run and
errs toward underspending, the safe direction. And ``total_spent`` moves in
$10 lumps and lags the discards that earned it, so for the first few weeks the
rate derived from it is noise; before ``WARMUP_DAYS`` it is not consulted at
all and the warm-up paces against a straight line to the budget. That pacing
test
reads the household's ``total_spent`` rather than our own, which is also what
stops a roster of several copies of this player from each claiming the whole
slack - after the warm-up, each copy sees the others' spend in ``others_rate``
and asks only for what is left.

The endgame is the same arithmetic. Once the money is gone the pool only
shrinks, since everyone's holes still leave it and nothing replaces them, and
a draw of fewer than two socks is the 65,536-point sockless penalty.
``_collapse_expected`` divides the wears the drawer has left by the
household's 2n a day and asks whether the run outlasts it; if it does not,
lam goes to its survival value, we discard nothing, and a quarter-hole
outweighs any mismatch - the drawer being protected is the one everybody
dresses from.

Tuning (5 training seeds, 10 held-out, rosters of 1-4 of us with greedy and
random roommates, $7,490 and $3,000 over 1,080 days) settled on lam = 3,
mu = 0, nu = 0.5 and no wear weight. mu is zero because the migration burden
of a pristine replacement is already priced, in embarrassment units, by the
``D(pristine)`` term; charging it again only throttled spend. The wear weight
is zero because, once the mismatch of the pair actually worn is counted, the
one-step change in a sock's potential is noise next to it.
